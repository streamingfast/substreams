# Substreams

## Welcome to Substreams documentation

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com).

> Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules, composing data streams alongside the community, and provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.
>
> Substreams have all the benefits of StreamingFast Firehose, like low-cost caching and archiving of blockchain data, high throughput processing, and cursor-based reorgs handling.

### Where to start

Learn about Substreams in a short, dense 25-minute intro and understand its impact on the blockchain ecosystem.

Learn about the benefits of Substreams, and how it compares to otheressential facts about Substreams through [reading the Benefits and comparison](concepts-and-fundamentals/benefits.md).

The primary ways to use Substreams include:

* [Installing the `substreams` CLI](getting-started/installing-the-cli.md)
* [Going through the Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md)

After installing Substreams and reviewing the Quickstart:

* You can [learn more about ](developers-guide/modules/)modules, and then [study the Developer's guide](developers-guide/overview.md).

Find pre-built Substreams by using the following resources:

* The [Substreams Template](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-template) helps expedite the process of getting you up and running.
* A [list of maintained Substreams examples](reference-and-specs/examples.md)

**You can view Substreams from two perspectives** as illustrated in the high-level visual diagram. It can be viewed through the perspective of the **Substreams engine** itself and also the perspective of the **end-user developer and consumer**.
