# Running Substreams

After a successful build Substreams can be started with the following command, explained in greater detail below.

```
substreams run -e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443 \
   substreams.yaml \
   map_transfers \
   --start-block 12292922 \
   --stop-block +1
```

### Explanation

#### Substreams Run

First, start the Substreams CLI tool passing it a `run` command.

#### Firehose URI

The server address is required by Substreams to connect to for data retrieval. The data provider for Substreams is located at the address. This is a running Firehose instance.\
`-e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443`

#### Substreams YAML Configuration File

Inform Substreams where to find the `substreams.yaml` configuration file.

#### Module

The `map_transfers` module is defined in the manifest and it is the module that will be run by Substreams.

#### Block Mapping

Start mapping at the specific block 12292922 by using passing the flag and block number. \
`--start-block 12292922`

Cease block processing with `--stop-block +1.` The +1 option will request a single block. In the example, the next block would be 12292923.

### Successful Substreams Results

The example output shown above contains data for different transfers from data in the blockchain. These transfers can also be verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcfb197f62ec5c7f0e71a11ec0c4a0e394a3aa41db5386e85526f86c84b3f2796).
