Running a Substreams means executing a Substreams package and consuming the data emitted. The data produced by a Substreams can be consumed in a variety of ways, such as using the CLI, a SQL database or a simple files.

## Running a Local Project

A typical Substreams local project contains Protobufs (`1`), modules (`2`) and a manifest (`substreams.yaml`) file (`3`):

If you are currently working on a local project, you can run your Substreams by specifying the location of the manifest:

```bash
substreams run -e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443 \
   substreams.yaml \
   map_transfers \
   --start-block 12292922 \
   --stop-block +1
```

The `--start-block` flag specifies the starting block of the Substreams (i.e. at which block the Substreams will start indexing data)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: In Solana, `--start-block` specifies the **slot**, not the block numnber.
{% endhint %}

### Substreams `run`

First, start the [`substreams` CLI](../reference-and-specs/command-line-interface.md) passing it a [`run`](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/reference-and-specs/command-line-interface#run) command.

### Firehose URI

The server address is required by Substreams to connect to for data retrieval. The data provider for Substreams is located at the address, which is a running Firehose instance.\
`-e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443`

### Substreams YAML configuration file

Inform Substreams where to find the `substreams.yaml` configuration file.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: The `substreams.yaml` configuration file argument in the command is optional if you are within the root folder of your Substreams and your manifest file is named `substreams.yaml.
{% endhint %}

### Module

The `map_transfers` module is defined in the manifest and it is the module run by Substreams.

### Block mapping

Start mapping at the specific block `12292922` by using passing the flag and block number `--start-block 12292922`.

Cease block processing by using `--stop-block +1.` The `+1` option requests a single block. In the example, the next block is `12292923`.

### Successful Substreams results

Messages are printed to the terminal for successfully installed and configured Substreams setups.

```bash
 substreams run -e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443 \
   substreams.yaml \
   map_transfers \
   --start-block 12292922 \
   --stop-block +1
```

The `substreams` [`run`](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/reference-and-specs/command-line-interface#run) command outputs:

```bash
2022-05-30T10:52:27.256-0400 INFO (substreams) connecting...

      "trxHash": "z7GX9i7Fx/DnGhHsDEoOOUo6pB21OG6FUm+GyEs/J5Y=",
      "ordinal": "85"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Running a Substreams Package (.spkg)

If you have an `spkg` file, you can run it by providing a path to the file:

```bash
substreams gui \
 https://spkg.io/streamingfast/erc20-balance-changes-v1.1.0.spkg \
 map_balance_changes \
 -e mainnet.eth.streamingfast.io:443 \
 --start-block 1397553
```

## Development and production mode

Substreams has two mode when executing your module(s) either development mode or production mode. Development
and production modes impact the execution of Substreams, important aspects of execution include:

* The time required to reach the first byte.
* The speed that large ranges get executed.
* The module logs and outputs sent back to the client.

### Differences

Differences between production and development modes include:

* Forward parallel execution is enabled in production mode and disabled in development mode
* The time required to reach the first byte in development mode is faster than in production mode.

Specific attributes of development mode include:

* The client will receive all of the executed module's logs.
* It's possible to request specific store snapshots in the execution tree.
* Multiple module's output is possible.

### Examples

In most cases, you will run production mode, using a Substreams sink. Development mode is enabled by default in the CLI unless the `-p` flag is specified.

Examples: (given the dependencies: `[block] --> [map_pools] --> [store_pools] --> [map_transfers])`

* Running the `substreams run substreams.yaml map_transfers` command executes in development mode and only prints the `map_transfers` module's outputs and logs.
* Running the `substreams run substreams.yaml map_transfers --debug-modules-output=map_pools,map_transfers,store_pools` command executes in development mode and only prints the outputs of the `map_pools`, `map_transfers`, and `store_pools` modules.
* Running the `substreams run substreams.yaml map_transfers -s 1000 -t +5 --debug-modules-initial-snapshot=store_pools` command executes in development mode and prints all the entries in the `store_pools` module at block 999, then continues with outputs and logs from the `map_transfers` module in blocks 1000 through 1004.
