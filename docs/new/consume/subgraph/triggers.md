**Substreams triggers allow you to embed Substreams data directly in your subgraph**. Essentially, you **import the Protobufs emitted by your Substreams module** and you receive the data in the handler of your subgraph.

You can find all the information related to triggers in [The Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sps/triggers/).
