In this guide, you'll learn how to initialize an EVM-based Substreams project. Youâ€™ll learn how to set up a simple project to extract raw data or filter EVM events and calls based on a smart-contract of interest.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and VS Code installed and up-to-date.
- Visit the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter) to initialize your development environment.

## Step 1: Initialize Your EVM Substreams Project

1. Open your development environment and run the following command to initialize your project:
    
    ```bash
    substreams init
    ```
    
2. You will be given the option to choose between two EVM project options. Select the one that best fits your requirements:
    - **evm-minimal**: Creates a simple Substreams that extracts raw data from the block and generates Rust code.
    - **evm-events-calls**: Creates a Substreams that extracts EVM events and calls using the cached [EVM Foundational Module](https://substreams.dev/streamingfast/ethereum-common/v0.3.0), filtered by one or more smart contract addresses.


## Step 2: Visualize the Data

1. Create your account [here](https://thegraph.market/) to generate an authentification token (JWT) and pass it as input to: 

    ```bash
    substreams auth
    ```

2. Run the following command to visualize and itterate on your filtered data model:

    ```bash
    Substreams Gui
    ````

## Step 3: Customize your Project 

After initialization, you can:

- Modify your Substreams manifest to include additional filters or configurations.
- Implement custom processing logic in Rust based on the filtered data retrieved by the foundational module.

For a deeper dive into use cases and details, refer to the [EVM Tutorials](../../tutorials/evm).
