# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Firehose integration

* Service now needs to pass a `client.Factory` instead of some client configuration.

## [0.0.21](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.21)

* Moved Rust modules to `github.com/streamingfast/substreams-rs`

### Library

* Gained significant execution time improvement when saving and loading stores, during the squashing process by leveraging [vtprotobuf](https://github.com/planetscale/vtprotobuf)

* Added XDS support for tier 2s

* Added intrinsic support for type `bigdecimal`, will deprecate `bigfloat`

* Significant improvements in code-coverage and full integration tests.

### CLI

* Added `substreams tools proxy <package>` subcommand to allow calling substreams with a pre-defined package easily from a web browser using bufbuild/connect-web

* Lowered GRPC client keep alive frequency, to prevent "Too Many Pings" disconnection issue.

* Added a fast failure when attempting to connect to an unreachable substreams endpoint.

* CLI is now able to read `.spkg` from `gs://`, `s3://` and `az://` URLs, the URL format must be supported by our [dstore](https://github.com/streamingfast/dstore) library).

* Command `substreams pack` is now restricted to local manifest file.

* Added command `substreams tools module` to introspect a store state in storage.

* Made changes to allow for `substreams` CLI to run on Windows OS (thanks @robinbernon).

* Added flag `--output-file <template>` to `substreams pack` command to control where the `.skpg` is written, `{manifestDir}` and `{spkgDefaultName}` can be used in the `template` value where  `{manifestDir}` resolves to manifest's directory and `{spkgDefaultName}` is the pre-computed default name in the form `<name>-<version>` where `<name>` is the manifest's "package.name" value (`_` values in the name are replaced by `-`) and `<version>` is `package.version` value.

* Fixed relative path not resolved correctly against manifest's location in `protobuf.files` list.

* Fixed relative path not resolved correctly against manifest's location in `binaries` list.

* `substreams protogen <package> --output-path <path>` flag is now relative to `<package>` if `<package>` is a local manifest file ending with `.yaml`.

* Endpoint's port is now validated otherwise when unspecified, it creates an infinite 'Connecting...' message that will never resolves.

## [0.0.20](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.20)

### CLI

* Fixed error when importing `http/https` `.spkg` files in `imports` section.

## [0.0.19](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.19)

**New updatePolicy `append`**, allows one to build a store that concatenates values and supports parallelism.  This affects the server, the manifest format (additive only), the substreams crate and the generated code therein.

### Rust API

- Store APIs methods now accept `key` of type `AsRef<str>` which means for example that both `String` an `&str` are accepted as inputs in:

  - `StoreSet::set`
  - `StoreSet::set_many`
  - `StoreSet::set_if_not_exists`
  - `StoreSet::set_if_not_exists_many`
  - `StoreAddInt64::add`
  - `StoreAddInt64::add_many`

  - `StoreAppend::append`
  - `StoreAppend::append_bytes`
  - `StoreGet::get_at`
  - `StoreGet::get_last`
  - `StoreGet::get_first`

- Low-level state methods now accept `key` of type `AsRef<str>` which means for example that both `String` an `&str` are accepted as inputs in:

  - `state::get_at`
  - `state::get_last`
  - `state::get_first`
  - `state::set`
  - `state::set_if_not_exists`
  - `state::append`
  - `state::delete_prefix`
  - `state::add_bigint`
  - `state::add_int64`
  - `state::add_float64`
  - `state::add_bigfloat`
  - `state::set_min_int64`
  - `state::set_min_bigint`
  - `state::set_min_float64`
  - `state::set_min_bigfloat`
  - `state::set_max_int64`
  - `state::set_max_bigint`
  - `state::set_max_float64`
  - `state::set_max_bigfloat`

- Bumped `prost` (and related dependencies) to `^0.11.0`

### CLI

* Environment variables are now accepted in manifest's `imports` list.

* Environment variables are now accepted in manifest's `protobuf.importPaths` list.

* Fixed relative path not resolved correctly against manifest's location in `imports` list.

* Changed the output modes: `module-*` modes are gone and become the
  format for `jsonl` and `json`. This means all printed outputs are
  wrapped to provide the module name, and other metadata.

* Added `--initial-snapshots` (or `-i`) to the `run` command, which
  will dump the stores specified as output modules.

* Added color for `ui` output mode under a tty.

* Added some request validation on both client and server (validate
  that output modules are present in the modules graph)

### Service

* Added support to serve the initial snapshot

## [v0.0.13](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.13)

### CLI

* Changed `substreams manifest info` -> `substreams info`
* Changed `substreams manifest graph` -> `substreams graph`
* Updated usage

### Service

* Multiple fixes to boundaries


## [v0.0.12](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.12)

### `substreams` server

* Various bug fixes around store and parallel execution.

### `substreams` CLI

* Fix null pointer exception at the end of CLI run in some cases.

* Do log last error when the CLI exit with an error has the error is already printed to the user and it creates a weird behavior.

## [v0.0.11](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.11)

### `substreams` Docker

* Ensure arguments can be passed to Docker built image.

## [v0.0.10-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.10-beta)

### `substreams` server

* Various bug fixes around store and parallel execution.
* Fixed logs being repeated on module with inputs that was receiving nothing.

## [v0.0.9-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.9-beta)

### `substreams` crate

* Added `substreams::hex` wrapper around hex\_literal::hex macro

### `substreams` CLI

* Added `substreams run -o ui|json|jsonl|module-json|module-jsonl`.

### Server

* Fixed a whole bunch of issues, in parallel processing. More stable caching. See chain-specific releases.

## [v0.0.8-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.8-beta)

* Fixed `substreams` crate usage from tagged version published on crates.io.

## [v0.0.7-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.7-beta)

* Changed `startBlock` to `initialBlock` in substreams.yaml [manifests](docs/reference-and-specs/manifests.md#modules-.initialblock).
* `code:` is now defined in the `binaries` section of the manifest, instead of in each module. A module can select which binary with the `binary:` field on the Module definition.
* Added `substreams inspect ./substreams.yaml` or `inspect some.spkg` to see what's inside. Requires `protoc` to be installed (which you should have anyway).
* Added command `substreams protogen` that writes a temporary `buf.gen.yaml` and generates Rust structs based on the contents of the provided manifest or package.
*   Added `substreams::handlers` macros to reduce boilerplate when create substream modules.

    `substreams::handlers::map` is used for the handlers corresponding to modules of type `map`. Modules of type `map` should return a `Result` where the error is of type `Error`

    ```rust
    /// Map module example
    #[substreams::handlers::map]
    pub fn map_module_func(blk: eth::Block) -> Result<erc721::Transfers, Error> {
         ...
    }
    ```

    `substreams::handlers::store` is used for the handlers corresponding to modules of type `store`. Modules of type `store` should have no return value.

    ```rust
    /// Map module example
    #[substreams::handlers::store]
    pub fn store_module(transfers: erc721::Transfers, s: store::StoreAddInt64, pairs: store::StoreGet, tokens: store::StoreGet) {
          ...
    }
    ```

## [v0.0.6-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.6-beta)

* Implemented [packages (see docs)](docs/reference-and-specs/packages.md).
* Added `substreams::Hex` wrapper type to more easily deal with printing and encoding bytes to hexadecimal string.
* Added `substreams::log::info!(...)` and `substreams::log::debug!(...)` supporting formatting arguments (acts like `println!()` macro).
* Added new field `logs_truncated` that can be used to determined if logs were truncated.
* Augmented logs truncation limit to 128 KiB per module per block.
* Updated `substreams run` to properly report module progress error.
* When a module WASM execution error out, progress with failure logs is now returned before closing the substreams connection.
* The API token is not passed anymore if the connection is using plain text option `--plaintext`.
* The `-c` (or `--compact-output`) can be used to print JSON as a single compact line.
* The `--stop-block` flag on `substream run` can be defined as `+1000` to stream from start block + 1000.

## [v0.0.5-beta3](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.5-beta3)

* Added Dockerfile support.

## [v0.0.5-beta2](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.5-beta2)

### Client

* Improved defaults for `--proto-path` and `--proto`, using globs.
* WASM file paths in substreams.yaml manifests now resolve relative to the location of the yaml file.
* Added `substreams manifest package` to create .pb packages to simplify querying using other languages. See the python example.
* Added `substreams manifest graph` to show the Mermaid graph alone.
* Improved mermaid graph layout.
* Removed native Go code support for now.

### Server

* Always writes store snapshots, each 10,000 blocks.
* A few tools to manage partial snapshots under `substreams tools`

## [v0.0.5-beta](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams/releases/tag/v0.0.5-beta)

First chain-agnostic release. THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE PROVIDE NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY GUARANTEES FOR THIS RELEASE.

See https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams for usage docs..

* Removed `local` command. See README.md for instructions on how to run locally now. Build `sfeth` from source for now.
* Changed the `remote` command to `run`.
* Changed `run` command's `--substreams-api-key-envvar` flag to \`\`--substreams-api-token-envvar`, and its default value is changed from` SUBSTREAMS\_API\_KEY`to`SUBSTREAMS\_API\_TOKEN\`. See README.md to learn how to obtain such tokens.
