# Substreams:SQL Deployable Service Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Generate a simple Substreams that extract all events from the Cryptopunks smart contract on Ethereum.
2. Feed your data into a local PostgreSQL database in a Docker-based development environment.
3. Develop and apply SQL transformations with [dbt models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models).
4. Go from a local Substreams:SQL environment to a shared hosted development environment.
5. Create a production `.spkg` package and test it locally
6. Deploy your `.spkg` to a production environment that fills a PostgreSQL database from your Substreams and applies dbt transformations automatically.

## Generate a Substreams project from the Cryptopunks ABI

* The cryptopunks address on mainnet is `0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb`

* Use the `substreams init` command to fetch the ABI from etherscan and scaffold a Substreams project:

```bash
substreams init
```

Fill the requested information (name: `cryptopunks`, protocol: `ethereum`, chain: `mainnet`, contract: `b47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb`)
```

Writing project files
Generating Protobuf Rust code
Project "cryptopunks" initialized at "/Users/stepd/repos"

Run 'make build' to build the wasm code.

The following substreams.yaml files have been created with different sink targets:
 * substreams.yaml: no sink target
 * substreams.sql.yaml: PostgreSQL sink
 * substreams.clickhouse.yaml: Clickhouse sink
 * substreams.subgraph.yaml: Sink into Substreams-based subgraph
```

* See the list of events that have been identified above. By default, each event type is mapped to its own table. This happens in the `map_events()` function inside `src/lib.rs` and the SQL schema is available in `schema.sql`.

* Build the rust code:

```bash
make build
```

You should see:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
   Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.69
   Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.12
   Compiling syn v1.0.109
   ...
   Compiling cryptopunks v0.0.1 (/Users/stepd/repos/cryptopunks)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 30.71s
```

## Start feeding a local database using 'substreams alpha service' and Docker

From another window:

```
SUBSTREAMS_API_TOKEN=(...) substreams alpha service serve
```

Back to your substreams project:

* Deploy your substreams locally to start putting data in your database:

```bash
substreams alpha service deploy substreams.sql.yaml
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** A new PostgreSQL container will be created at port `5432`. The deployment will fail if there is another Docker container using that port.
{% endhint %}

You should see:

```bash
Deploying... (creating services, please wait)
Deployed substreams sink "7590fdbf":
  Status: STOPPED
Running your deployment inside local docker containersServices:
  - 7590fdbf-pgweb: PGWeb service "7590fdbf-pgweb" available at URL: 'http://localhost:8081'
  - 7590fdbf-postgraphile: Postgraphile service "7590fdbf-postgraphile" available at URL: 'http://localhost:3000/graphiql' (API at 'http://localhost:3000/graphql')
  - 7590fdbf-postgres: PostgreSQL service "7590fdbf-postgres" available at DSN: 'postgres://dev-node:insecure-change-me-in-prod@localhost:5432/substreams?sslmode=disable'
  - 7590fdbf-sink: Sink service (no exposed port). Use 'substreams alpha sink-info 7590fdbf' to see last processed block or 'docker logs 7590fdbf-sink' to see the logs.
  - 7590fdbf-sinkinfo: Sink info service "7590fdbf-sinkinfo" available at URL: 'http://localhost:8282/sinkinfo'
```

* Look at some SQL data via pgweb at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** You can run `substreams alpha service pause` if you want to pause the sink from consuming Substreams data while you continue your development. `substreams alpha service resume` will continue the progress.
{% endhint %}

## Create a dbt project for transformations

* Initialize the dbt project:

```bash
dbt init cryptopunks
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Choose 'postgres' as the database.
{% endhint %}

* Move that project under 'dbt' folder:

```bash
mv cryptopunks dbt
```
* Edit the dev credentials under $HOME/.dbt/profiles.yml file:

```bash
...
cryptopunks:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      user: dev-node
      password: insecure-change-me-in-prod
      port: 5432
      dbname: substreams
      schema: public
...
  target: dev

```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** You can see the database credentials again by running `substreams alpha service info`
{% endhint %}

* Test the dbt connection

```bash
dbt debug
```

You should see:

```bash
16:04:10  All checks passed!
```

* Remove the example models:

```bash
rm -rf models/example
```

* Create a datasource and a basic materialized view:

```bash
mkdir models/default

cat <<EOF > models/default/source.yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: cryptopunks
    loaded_at_field: evt_block_time
    tables:
      - name: punk_bought
      - name: punk_bid_entered
      - name: punk_offered
      - name: punk_no_longer_for_sale
      - name: punk_transfer
      - name: punk_bid_withdrawn
      - name: transfer
      - name: assign
EOF

cat <<EOF > models/default/punks_bought_per_hour.sql
{{ config(materialized='table') }}

select date_trunc('hour', evt_block_time) AS "hour", count(*) from punk_bought  GROUP BY hour order by hour
EOF
```

* Create your views:

```bash
dbt run
```

* Check that the `punks_bought_per_hour` has been created.

## Deploy your Substreams to the "hosted dev" environment

Deployments of type "dev" gives you full read/write access to the database and are a good way of working together on a dataset while developing your dbt models.

```bash
substreams alpha service deploy substreams.sql.yaml -e https://deploy.streamingfast.io
```

You should see this output:

```bash
Deployed substreams sink "54546874":
  Status: RUNNING
Deployment *54546874* is *RUNNING*
  - Database type is *postgres*
  - Owner is *0doqed628575ba7d2bd03*

Indexed blocks: [12287507 - 12326000]
  - Sink status is available at 'https://srv.streamingfast.io/54546874/sinkinfo'

Environment is *Development*, which means:
  - Read-only direct access to the database is available at 'postgresql://db.srv.streamingfast.io:17622/substreams?sslmode=disable&user=dev-node-ro&password=iv2rqsKsUVH5'
  - Read/write direct access to the database is available at 'postgresql://db.srv.streamingfast.io:17622/substreams?sslmode=disable&user=dev-node&password=oTWPmz2Sqssb'
  - Read/write access to the database via PGWeb at 'https://srv.streamingfast.io/54546874/pgweb'

Postgraphile is available at these URL:
  - GraphiQL (browser): 'https://srv.streamingfast.io/54546874/graphiql'
  - GraphQL (apps): 'https://srv.streamingfast.io/54546874/graphql'

See some tutorials at https://substreams.streamingfast.io
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** You are getting SQL credentials in this output. They can be fetched again by running `substreams alpha service info 46f5e9f6 -e https://deploy.streamingfast.io`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** The SQL endpoint will be assigned a specific port mapped to your deployment, in this example, port 17622.
{% endhint %}

* Create another target in your `$HOME/.dbt/profiles.yml` replacing `PORT_NUMBER` and `RW_PASSWORD` with those assigned to you on the previous step:

```bash
cryptopunks:
  outputs:
...
    remote:
      type: postgres
      host: db.srv.streamingfast.io
      user: dev-node
      password: {RW_PASSWORD}
      port: {PORT_NUMBER}
      dbname: substreams
      schema: public
```

* You can iterate using `dbt run --target=remote`
* Other devs can work on that data and create dbt models.

## Pack your production package and test it locally

When your dbt models are ready, you can pack everything (Substreams, [dbt project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/projects), etc.) inside an `.spkg` file and deploy it as production:

* Add a `dbt_config` section to the `substreams.sql.yaml` file:

```yaml
    dbt_config:
      enabled: true
      files: "./dbt"
      run_interval_seconds: 180
```

* Start the `substreams alpha service serve` command in another window (if it is not still running from before...)

```bash
SUBSTREAMS_API_TOKEN=(...) substreams alpha service serve
```

* Stop the previous deployment completely (only a single deployment can run at the same time on local Docker environment)

```bash
substreams alpha service stop
```

* Test your deployment locally, in production mode:

```bash
substreams alpha service deploy substreams.sql.yaml --prod
```

* See that the database starts correctly and that the tables defined in `dbt` are being created correctly

* When you are happy with the results, verify or bump the `version` field in `substreams.sql.yaml`, you can generate the `cryptopunks-v0.1.0.spkg` file.

```bash
substreams pack substreams.sql.yaml
```

## Deploy your production package to the "hosted prod" environment

```bash
substreams alpha service deploy cryptopunks-v0.1.0.spkg -e https://deploy.streamingfast.io --prod
```

The production environment does not allow direct SQL access at the moment, so your apps will need to access the data to either the `rest` frontend or the `postgraphile` frontend.
