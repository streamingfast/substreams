    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Scheduled: via NextJob()
    %%  the scheduler claims the next job that can be processed, we don't have files for
    %%  it, and its dependencies are all met
    Pending --> PartialPresent: init or polling
    %%  two ways to get there:
    %%  1. initial storage state fetcher found a partial, without spinning up a job for it,
    %%  it's waiting and we'll want to watch for the existence of this file, because it
    %%  could disappear. In this case, it would return to Pending
    %%  2. some polling mechanism discovers a partial file without a job having been scheduled
	%%
    %%  when there's a newly discovered partial, we'll want to ask the Squasher if something
    %%  can be done with that partial next.
    %%NO: Pending --> Merging
    %%  we'll leave the messaging schedule the Squasher and take it from PartialPresent --> Merging
    Pending --> Completed: init storage fetch
    %%  the initial storage state fetcher found a file with the complete store, and we've
    %%  scheduled the squasher to load the latest that we found, and marked all the
    %%  preceding ones as having a complete snapshot on disk (to satisfy any dependent jobs)

    %%NO: PartialPresent --> Pending: squasher didn't find partial
    %%  we'll let PartialPresent go to the squasher, and if it doesn't find it
    %%  then, it can make it Pending back from the Merging state.
    %%  eventually, we could optimize and look out for those partial files
    %%  pre-emptively, and schedule the job sooner, instead of waiting
    %%  for the moment the Squasher needs it before making it Pending again.
    %%NO: PartialPresent --> Scheduled:
    %%  wouldn't make sense to schedule anything if the Partial is present, merge it instead
    PartialPresent --> Merging: was next in line\nsquasher started work
    %%  a check with the merger confirms that this segment is the next in line, so we
    %%  schedule it for merging. One at a time, means that we still have the polling
    %%  mechanism free to adjust for the next partials, and schedule something if,
    %%  when this one is done, the next one returned to Pending (the partial was deleted).
    %%  A message at the end of merging will come back to the scheduler, so that it schedules
    %%  the next contiguous one for squashing.
    %%  QUESTION: if there's nothing for squashing on the next run, which message will kick
    %%  back the squashing loop?
    %%    * the moment a job finishes, or a Partial is discovered, we'll question the Squasher
    %%      for its squashing state, and schedule the next contiguous one.
    %%NO: PartialPresent --> Completed
    %%  Could it be that we discover a complete store, and so before we launch the squasher
    %%  on the present partial, we'll rather reload the complete store (if its the next one)
    %%  For now, we'll require that partials be merged linearly, and not support the discovery
    %%  of a complete store, when the Partial has chances to be merged in just a moment.

    %%NO: Scheduled --> Pending
    %%  if a job has been scheduled, it either completes, or retries on its own, but doesn't
    %%  come back to Pending.
    Scheduled --> PartialPresent: job done,\npartial on disk
    %%  two ways we get to a PartialPresent state:
    %%  1. the job finishes and reports that a new Partial is awaiting merging
    %%  2. a polling mechanism discovers a new Partial (in which case, we'll preemptively cancel the job if one was running
    %%NO: Scheduled --> Merging:
    %%  we don't go directly from Scheduled to Merging, we'll leave the PartialPresent state
    %%  flow through to Merging.
    %%NO: Scheduled --> Completed:
    %%  it's the squasher's responsibility to take the output of a job, and make it complete
    %%  not the job scheduler, so again, transit through PartialPresent --> Merging --> Completed

    Merging --> Pending: squasher didn't\nfind partial
    %%NO: Merging --> PartialPresent
    %%  no, you're merging that partial, if you can't, we go back to Pending
    %%NO: Merging --> Scheduled
    %%  no
    Merging --> Completed: squasher finished\nfinal store ready for segment
    %%  we have successfully merged the partials into a complete store
    %%NO: Completed --> Pending: no need
    %%NO: Completed --> PartialPresent: you're done the work already, so don't do that
    %%NO: Completed --> Scheduled: all work is done, shut up
    %%NO: Completed --> Merging: all work is done, shut up

    Completed --> [*]

    [*] --> NoOp: no processing needed
    NoOp --> [*]

// TODO: UnitCompleted might mean two things: the fact a FullKV is on disk,

//  that we sent a goroutine to write to storage, but it hasn't reached the Bucket
//  yet.
//  We want to distinguish those to make sure merging happens as _quickly_ as
//  possible when there are many partials to merge, but we also want to know
//  when the files are indeed present on disk (being detected, or after the _write_
//  operation of the merging operation successfully finished).
